# Customer Segmentation Analysis with Clustering

This repository contains a data analysis project that focuses on customer segmentation using clustering techniques. Customer segmentation is a crucial strategy for businesses to understand and target their customer base effectively. In this project, we explore a dataset of mall customers, analyze their characteristics, and cluster them into distinct groups based on their annual income and spending score. Additionally, we visualize the results in 3D to gain a comprehensive view of customer segmentation.

## Dataset

## Project Overview

The project is structured into the following sections:

1. **Importing Necessary Libraries**: We start by importing essential Python libraries required for data analysis and visualization.

2. **Loading and Reading Dataset**: The mall customer dataset is loaded, which contains customer information such as gender, age, annual income, and spending score.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: We perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset, including visualizations of data distribution and feature correlations.

4. **Clustering**: The core part of the project focuses on clustering customers based on annual income and spending score using the K-Means clustering algorithm. We determine the optimal number of clusters using the "elbow method" and visualize the results.

5. **3D Scatterplot**: To gain a deeper understanding of customer segmentation, we create a 3D scatterplot that incorporates age, annual income, and spending score. This visualization helps us visualize how different customer segments are distributed in this 3D space.

Customer segmentation allows businesses to tailor their marketing strategies and services to different customer groups, ultimately improving customer satisfaction and business success.
